# Renting Platform
This repository has been publicized since the backend and frontend files merged to different repositories due to SoC principles. Therefore project you see here is **incomplete**. If you *fork*, *clone* etc. you must know I do not take responsibilites for faulty components. However you're allowed to examine, change and develop on this basis. If you have questions or project you want to create, you can reach me out via email. Have a nice day!

**ps:** *Don't forget to change Firebase configurations. It'll be deactived when production phase finish.*
